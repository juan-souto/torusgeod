Sources of geodesics:
- Random geodesics (maybe with respect to parameters?)
- Random word in \pi_1 (or Random Farey, if one really wants)
- Random simple
- enter an element in \pi_1
- enter a matrix
- apply a mapping class

        One has to decide if one is ok forcing the geodesic to go from left to right in the imaginary axis

What to do with individual geodesics I --- combinatorial:
- Continued fraction expansion (at least if square torus)
- linking number of Lorentz knot (again for square torus)    (?)
- self-intersection number
- homology class

What to do with individual geodesics II --- geometric with parameters:
- length
- depth in cusps                                            TBD
- longest time in a cusp                                    TBD
- proportion of time in cusp                                TBD
- intersection angles with edges of triangulation           TBD

What to do about parameters
- find systole                                              TBD
- find maximal stretch lamination                           TBD
- find parameters minimizing length of given curve          TBD

Sources of sequences of geodesics:
- Sequences of geodesics out of a random ray
- Random simple geodesics
- Iterate PA
- Random sequence in Map

What to do with sequences of geodesics:
- i(gamma,gamma)/l(gamma)^2
- i(gamma,alpha)/l(gamma)
- size of homology class
- Thurston ball
- limiting lamination

Others
- intersection of simple random geodesics (single and expectation)
